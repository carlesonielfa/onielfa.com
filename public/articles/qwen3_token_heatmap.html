<p>Most embedding models collapse an entire sentence (or longer document chunk) into <strong>one</strong> vector. That abstraction is perfect for ranking documents, yet it intentionally discards token-level nuance.</p>
<p><em>The good news</em>: those fine-grained token vectors are still hiding inside the model’s last hidden layer, we just rarely look at them.</p>
<p>In this post we dust them off and treat every token as a tiny queryable unit.</p>
<p>By taking a simple cosine-similarity (dot product on ℓ2-normalised vectors) between a user question and each token, we can paint a heatmap that lights up <em>precisely</em> where the semantic match lives, even inside a 32 k-token context window.</p>
<p>We can then leverage this information to extract relevant text spans.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-running-example-you-can-meme-orise">A running example you can meme-orise</h3>
<p>To keep things concrete we’ll work with an odd corpus: a 2005 “SpongeBob SquarePants Laptop” user manual. It is publicly available, short enough to follow on screen while still making use of the lengthy context window. We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embed the entire PDF and a sample query with <strong>Qwen3-0.6B-Instruct</strong>.</li>
<li>Compute per-token relevance and surface the results as color-graded heatmaps.</li>
<li>Postprocess the relevance signal to extract text spans.</li>
<li>Observe the results for other queries.</li>
<li>Compare Qwen3 with Late-interaction (ColBERT) models.</li>
</ul>
<p>All with cool animated illustrations to support the the process.</p>

<p>The Qwen3 family of <strong>embedding</strong> models have been released on July 2025 under Apache-2.0 license.</p>
<p>They come in three sizes (0.6B, 4B and 8B), and feature a decoder-only architecture, based on that of the Qwen3 LLMs.</p>
<p>They are now top of the leaderboards, blowing out of the water previous models, setting a new standard for the state of the art in text embedding models.</p>
<p>Let’s load the 0.6B version!</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By default, these embeddings models will generate a single vector of 2560 dimensions (matching the “hidden size” of the model) for each input text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In embedding models the single embedding vector is generated through pooling the last hidden state, usually through averaging the embeddings for each of the tokens or by selecting the embedding of a special token.</p>
<p>In the case of the Qwen3 embeddings this is achieved by just selecting the embedding for the special token <code>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code>, which is inserted as the last token in the batch by the tokenization process.</p>
<p>During training the model learns to make the embedding of this special token represent the entire input text, and thus it can be used as a compact representation of the input.</p>
<p>However, we can choose to forgo this pooling step. By not applying this pooling, we will be generating a matrix of size <code>(tokenized_text_length, 1024)</code>, resulting in an embedding vector for each token.</p>

<p>As we are going to embed our document as a single chunk, one might be worried about the contents being to lengthy and running up against the context window limits for the model.</p>
<p>However, for these Qwen3 embedding models, the context window is a staggering 32k tokens, which makes it likely that our whole document will fit, however let’s make sure by looking at the size of our tokenized document.</p>
<p>At the same time we compute these embeddings, we will be extracting a text representation of each of the tokens and a mapping between token to text position. This is useful for plotting each token and to convert from tokens indices to text indices once we know which tokens are relevant.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-we-score-every-token-from-cosine-similarity-to-one-big-matrix">How we score every token: from cosine similarity to one big matrix</h2>
<p>When comparing <strong>sentence</strong> embeddings, we usually use <strong>cosine similarity</strong> to measure how close they are:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{cos\_sim}(\mathbf u, \mathbf v)
=
\frac{\mathbf u^{\top}\mathbf v}{\lVert\mathbf u\rVert_2 \lVert\mathbf v\rVert_2}
\]</span></p>
<p>For <strong>token</strong> embeddings, we do the same — but we normalize every token vector so its length is 1. This means:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\lVert\mathbf u\rVert_2 = \lVert\mathbf v\rVert_2 = 1
\]</span></p>
<p>so cosine similarity simplifies to a dot product:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{cos\_sim}(\mathbf u,\mathbf v) = \mathbf u^{\top}\mathbf v.

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> has shape <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span>: each row corresponds to a query token, each column to a document token</li>
<li>values are between <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> because all token vectors are unit-normalized</li>
<li>modern frameworks (like <code>torch.matmul</code>) can compute these millions of dot products in a single call, making it extremely fast even for long contexts</li>
</ul>
<p>All downstream logic starts from this single compact matrix <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collapsing-to-document-token-relevance-over-the-whole-query">Collapsing to document token relevance over the whole query</h3>
<p>We know that the Qwen3 embedding models are trained by taking the embedding for the <code>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code> token as the representative embedding for the whole text.</p>
<p>So the relevance score that we would see by using the embedding model with pooling <strong>corresponds to the relevance value on the last row and last column of the relevance matrix</strong>. Which is measuring the relevance between both of the <code>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code> tokens.</p>
<p>Using this information, if we wish to see the relevance of each document token to the whole query, is as easy as visualizing only the last row of this relevance matrix. As we would be comparing the relevance of the <code>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code> token (representative of the query) to each document token.</p>
<p>Knowing this, the relevance computation could have been simplified even further by just computing the relevance of the last row of the matrix, instead of computing the whole matrix.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R_{\text{last}} = Q_\text{last} D^{\top}
\]</span></p>
<p>Focusing our attention on this plot, we can observe some patterns appearing, namely, hotspots with high relevance along the document.</p>

<p>Much better!</p>
<p>We can now observe how the relevance is not uniform across the document, and that we have the strongest relevance in the middle of page 9, and along page 10, which matches the general area where the answer to our query is located.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-relevant-spans">Finding relevant spans</h2>
<p>Now, how can we extract relevant spans from this noisy data?</p>
<p>Looking at the raw data (you may hover over the line graph to see to which tokens correspond each of the scores), there seems to be a pattern in which the relevance will be higher at the end of relevant sentences rather than in specific relevant tokens.</p>
<p>It seems like the model may be combining and encoding the meaning of the previous tokens on those later tokens, which fits into the fact that the Qwen3 embedding models are based on a decoder-only architecture which does not use bidirectional attention like encoder based embedding models do.</p>
<p>This means that if we detect a high relevance token, it might be indicating that the tokens previous to that one are relevant as well.</p>
<p>Let’s zoom into a specific sentence to showcase how high relevance appears at line endings such as <code>\n</code> or <code>.</code></p>

<p>We now know that the peaks in the relevance signal are key, matching ends of relevance sentences and occasionally, exact text matches.</p>
<p>Let’s devise an algorithm to extract these relevant spans. For that a naive implementation might follow something like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Preprocess the relevance signal</strong> (optional):
<ul>
<li>I have found that using a smoothing filter such a gaussian filter makes the signal easier to work with for the next steps.</li>
<li>The adjustable parameter for this filter is <code>sigma</code>, which controls the amount of smoothing applied. A larger value will result in a smoother signal, while a smaller value will retain more of the original signal’s peaks and troughs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Detect peaks</strong>: Find tokens with relevance above a specific set <code>threshold</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster nearby peaks</strong>: Use a sliding window approach to cluster nearby peaks, the distance between peaks is controlled by a parameter <code>delta</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Filter out small spans</strong> (optional): Remove spans that have less than <code>min_span_size</code> tokens. This steps aids in removing matches that may be purely based on a single token matching lexically.</li>
<li><strong>Extend the clusters</strong>: Extend the match forwards and backwards until a separator is found to match a semantic unit, up to a maximum of <code>max_extension</code> tokens in each direction.</li>
<li><strong>Compute scores for each span</strong>: This can be done via different aggregations of the relevance scores in the span. By using the maximum, we get a representative value that is invariant on how the cluster is extended.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the graph above we can observe how the different queries match drastically different parts of the document and how they generally match the ground truth spans.</p>
<p>One interesting recurrent pattern is that towards the end of the document, we see increasing relevance for all queries until a peak at the end of the document.</p>
<p>This is interesting because following the theory that the unidirectional attention of the Qwen3 embedding models will encode the meaning of the previous tokens in the later ones, this means that the model is likely encoding the meaning of the document in the last tokens, which matches what it has been trained to do with the <code>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code> token, which is the last token in the document.</p>
<p>This might compromise this methodology as a general solution for extracting relevant spans, as the relevance scoring might be biased towards the end of the document.</p>
<p>To combat this, the model should be trained to encode the relevance at the token level, rather than at the end of the document, which is a limitation on how the Qwen3 embedding models are trained.</p>
<p>Models trained with a more fine-grained approach, such as the <strong>ColBERT</strong> family of models, would theoretically not have this issue, but as we will see in the next section, they do not perform as well as this model on the task of token-level relevance scoring.</p>
<p>Below you can visualize the most relevant text spans for each of the queries.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparison-to-late-interaction-embedding-models-colbert">Comparison to late-interaction embedding models (ColBERT)</h2>
<p>Late Interaction models such as ColBERT, are embedding models that represent queries and documents with token-level embeddings and use the MaxSim metric to score relevance. These models should be perfect candidates for this span level matching as they have been trained to output a vector per token.</p>
<p>I expermiented with two popular ColBERT models that fit large contexts, those being the <code>jina-colbert-v2</code> from jina and the <code>GTE-ModernColBERT-v1</code> from LightOn AI (The original <code>ColBERT</code> and <code>ColBERT v2.0</code> where not tested because of their limitation on context length).</p>
<p>In my experimentation, I haven’t been able to adapt the approach to these late-interaction models.</p>
<p><code>GTE-ModernColBERT-v1</code> weirdly exhibits a high relevance for the whole document and although <code>jina-colbert-v2</code> shows a clearer relevance signal, that signal is noisier than with the Qwen models and the relevance peaks seem to cluster to specific values, removing nearly all nuance in token-level relevance.</p>
<p>One hypothesis is that although these models have been trained for the multi vector representation, they are trained to compress the embeddings for each token into a lower dimensionality vector of 128 dimensions normally, which is much lower than the 1024 dimensions of the Qwen3 embeddings, which may be causing the model to lose some of the token-level information.</p>
<p>Below are the code and plots for the same exercise with the <code>jina-colbert-v2</code> model, although you may swap out the model to test any other model supported by <code>pylate</code>.</p>

<p><em>The mask tokens have been left in as they serve as query expansion tokens, improving retrieval performance https://arxiv.org/html/2408.13672v1</em></p>
<p>To group the relevance scores into a vector containing relevance, we now don’t have a <code>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code> token from which we can extract that relevance for the whole query.</p>
<p>Intuitively aggregating using the <strong>maximum</strong> relevance for the query tokens makes sense, as that following the <code>MaxSim</code> metric that is used to compute relevance for these models.</p>
<p>I also tried using pooling using the <strong>mean</strong> and selecting the start of text (<code>&lt;s&gt;</code>) token.</p>
<p>We can see the resulting relevance signal compared with the one from the Qwen3 model in the following plot.</p>
<p>We will also compute the F1 Score between the relevant span and those extracted by each model and aggregation.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In this context, the F1 Score measures how much the predicted span overlaps the gold span while balancing extra tokens (precision errors) and missing tokens (recall errors) in a single 0-to-1 metric.</p>

<p>In the comparison we can observe that the ColBERT model does not exhibit a clear relevance signal peak in the expected region as many other peaks along the document match the relevance of the ground truth span, because of that, it is unlikely that tweaking the algorithm parameters will yield better results.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Qwen3 model shows a more distinct peak at the ground truth span, indicating a stronger alignment with the expected relevance signal.</p>
<p>The F1 scores corroborate this, As for the ColBERT model variations the scores are significantly lower than for the Qwen3 model.</p>
